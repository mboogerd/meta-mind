# Development

We recommend a separate development vault for the workflow below:

-   Clone this repository
-   Run `npm install` from the root of the clone
-   Install the [Hot Reload plugin](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) in the meantime.
-   Create a symlink (`ln -s [repo-path]`) from your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder to your clone of this repo
-   Run `npm run dev` from the root of the clone
